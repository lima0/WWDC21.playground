 ### Introduction
 Computer networks are now a huge part of our lives, we access the internet through our phones, tablets, computers, smartwatches and so many other devices. This playground aims to explain part of that process, which is network sockets and will also show an example of a basic HTTP server. I hope that it will be a fun experience for you to use :)
 
 note: You may get an alert from your operating system about accessing local networks, that isn't needed since only localhost is accessed
